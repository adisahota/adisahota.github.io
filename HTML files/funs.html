			        Formula One is the pinnacle of motor-sport. It's a competition between the best teams with the great engineers, and the 
			        fastest and bravest drivers from around the world.
			        Lets talk about the protagonists of F1 - the drivers. The drivers are amazing atheletes who risk their life everytime they
			        step into the car.They need to stay extremely fit as even a 1-2 pounds of their body weight can set them back a tenth of
			        of a second which is crucial factor to win in F1. The drivers can pull up to 3-4 G's of force everytime they go at 250km/h
			        around a corner, and lose nearly 5-10 lbs every race.<br><br>
			        In my opinion the greatest drivers of all time are:<br><br>
			        <ol>
			        	<li><span class = "highlight hide">Lewis Hamilton</span></li>
			        	<li><span class = "highlight hide">Micheal Schumacher</span></li>
			        	<li><span class = "highlight hide">Fernando Alonso</span></li>
			        	<li><span class = "highlight hide">Aryton Senna</span></li>
			        	<li><span class = "highlight hide">Sebastian Vettel</span></li>
			        </ol>

			        My favourite F1 racecar, the 2020 <i>Mercedes-AMG F1 W11 EQ Performance</i>, it took thirteen wins, fifteen pole 
			  		positions and won mercedes and Lewis Hamilton their 7th consecutive World Championship.
			  		It is also the one of the very few cars which could take the "Pouhon" corner of the Spa-francorchamps circuit flat out at 
			  		300km/h. For reference most F1 cars can only do 240-250km/h, 260km/h if the driver is brave enough to suffer 6 G's of 
			  		lateral force on their neck. Here's a picture gallery of a few of my favourite F1 circuits:

	  			Basketball is another sport which I enjoy very much. It's a fun sport with many great moments throughout its rich and 

	  			varied history. My favourite player is Kobe Bryant. Here's my favourite clip in basketball, a dunk made by Kobe against 

	  			in 2003.
